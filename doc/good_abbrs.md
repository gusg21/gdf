# Good Abbreviation List

I found an extensive list online that was pretty good but I figured it was probably better to make one from scratch, more of a whitelist.

- pos (position)
- vel (velocity)
- coords (coordinates)
- id (identifier)
- evt (event)
- ptr (pointer)
- ren (renderer)
- u (union, specifically in situations where it's obvious and just shorthand: see `map_event`)
- tl/br (top left and bottom right, used in conjunction which makes it clear)
